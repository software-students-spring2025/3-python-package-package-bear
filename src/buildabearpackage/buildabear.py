# ******** Alex
# This function sets up the inital pet
# and starts the clock/ timing for
# hunger, cleanliness, and happiness to go down
# Also show initial startup diaglogue & instructions
# Something like : Hi! I'm Bear! Nice to meet you!
# Feed me to keep me happy! Work a job to earn money!... etc
# MOST IMPORTANT DIRECTION:
# TELL USER TO USE check_status after using play to check on pet
# play is only the initializer!!!!
# !!!! SET INITIALIZED TO TRUE AFTER!!!
# !!!!! MIGHT NEED TO CHANGE THIS LATER IN MAIN WHEN RUN/ PACKAGE AND NOT AS A FUNCTION!!!!!
